# Create React Chess AI

Well this is the end of Christmas break. With that I'll need to go back and delve
back into work. All in all this was a lot of fun to put together, and I'm very 
happy I got over the first hurdle of making it work.

Going forward I'll need to look at two things first is that everything is very
slow, and I'll need to work on teh minimax and alpha beta pruning algorithms to
speed everything up. This will come at the cost of picking the best move, but
so far it appears that any chess AI is a balance of speed versus ability to
select the best move. 

Alongside algorithm improvements there was a lot of porting code into TypeScript
as well as attempting to code an algorithm from various source including 
academic papers (never try this at home). Everything could do with a lot of
refactoring and slimming down.

As a reminder for future features I'd be looking at turning on and off the AI so
I can get it to help with moves as I'm playing. Ooh something cool might be to 
allow me to play a game against the AI and when I'm stuck I can phone a friend 
essentially which is asking the AI to suggest possible moves. Perhaps using 
something visual to denote different moves, a couple of moves or strategies.
