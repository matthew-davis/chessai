# Create React Chess AI

Well this is the end of Christmas break, this was a lot fo fun to put together,
but it has some nasty draw backs. While it works it is incredibly slow and 
resource hungry. I'll keep it in my list of projects as something I need to
go back to and rework the minimax algorithm to run more efficiently even at the
expense of best move. 

I was also attempting to port several items into TypeScript while also spending 
time working through other's ideas of how to implement both the minimax and the
alpha beta pruning. This code could do with a nice dose of refactoring, but for
a Christmas project I'm happy that I've got over the first hurdle and got 
everything up and running.
